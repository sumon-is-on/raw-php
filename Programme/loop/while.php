# While Loop

/* while lop works untill or unless the condition is true. 
first it will check the condition , if it is true , it will execute the statements and then agin 
check the condition. now if it is true again it will execute the statements again, and got fo the condition . 
this is how the while loop works.

/* 
while(expression){
    statements;
}

# example:
$n=5;
while($n<=10){
    printf("%d\n",$n);
    // echo "hi";
    $n++;
}
